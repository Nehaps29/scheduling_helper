# Scheduling Helper

## Schedular

My motivation behind creating this app was TIME MANAGEMENT. I specifically wanted to have it from 9 AM-5 PM, so that I could note down things I needed to complete in those hours before I start it, so that I can manage my tasks effectively. This app also highlights the block with current hours in red, past hours in gray and future hours in green. There is a specified text area where you can note down your task for the day and click on the save button. Even when you refresh your page, your data will still be available, as I have used local storage.  In addition to this, date and time is displayed on the top section of the scheduler.
